    <h3>Positives</h3>
    <li>Summer always has the warm weather and heat that many people love making for a great vacation.</li>
    <li>This is always a great time to go to an ocean or a lake and go swimming and suntanning with your family and friends.</li>
    <h3>Negatives</h3>
    <li>But with summer, there is always hurricanes and bad thunderstorms. Especially on the east or west coast, hurricanes can be brutal.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the weather can be too hot to do anything, and you'll be constantly sweating which isn't fun.</li>
