    <td>The Winter time always brings good vibes especially with Christmas and New Years</td>
    <td>Sometimes it can be way too cold and too hard to deal with.</td>

        <td>The snow always takes me back to my childhood when I would go and play in the snow with my dog.</td>
        <td>When there is snow it is always terrible because nobody wants to have to shovel snow before school or work.</td>

        <td>Sitting inside with the heat on, playing video games, and having a hot drink is always a heartwarming moment</td>
