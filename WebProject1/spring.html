    <h3>Positives</h3>
    <li>Spring is always a great time to grow plants and possibly even grow food in the garden.</li>
    <li>As the weather starts to warm up it is always an enjoyable season.</li>
    <h3>Negatives</h3>
    <li>Unfortunately with spring comes pollen, and for people with allergies this is the worst season.</li>
    <li>The first half of spring is always really cold making it still feel like winter weather.</li>
